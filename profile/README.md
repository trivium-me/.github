# Trivium Me

Teaching the world grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric--starting with Latin, and eventually ancient Greek.

## Roadmap

### Laying a foundation with Dr. Paul P.'s Latin 1

#### Building a network

To kick things off, we hope to establish a network of classical Latin enthusiests who would be willing to help write, edit, critique, and record our first Latin course audio to be made freely and publicly available on [LibriVox](https://librivox.org/pages/volunteer-for-librivox/).

#### Building a toolset

Audio scripts would need to be formatted to a common industry standard, such as found in [Fountain](https://fountain.io/). We hope to not just write audio scripts, but to generate them. Writing and editing a community driven audio script might deviate from what an ideal Dr. Paul P. language lesson might be. It could get hectic! So, we hope to create a tool for generating audio scripts. It might be a set of modules to enhance Fountain to our use-case or to create automated Fountain generators based on some lesson structure, like:

```
{
    "name": "Dr. Paul P.'s Latin 1",
    "unit": 1,
    "speakers": [
        "speaker 1": { "gender": "female" },
        "speaker 2": { "gender": "male" }
    ],
    "target-conversation": [
        "speaker 1": "Excuse me, sir. Do you understand Latin?",
        "speaker 2": "Hi. Sorry, I don't understand.",
        "speaker 1": "Oh. Are you American?",
        "speaker 2": "Yes, ma'am. Do you speak English?",
        "speaker 1": "Mmmm. A little.",
    ],
    "vocabulary":[
        ...
```

This script generating progam _might_ take some structure, like the above, and generate iteritive vocabulary scripts to go over clear sylabic pronounciation breakdowns, helping the listener acquire an ear for the language and allowing pauses to give the student chances to engage with the speakers in the audio recording: "-ne. -ne. -gisne. -gisne. Intele-. Intelegisne? Say, 'Do you understand?' Intelegisne?"

Another tool might be used to generate an audio recording inventory list. Repeated phrases can be recorded once and used throughout the course and future courses, cut together with the correct pause time for a generated lesson audio file.

#### Building toward classical reading

The foundations laid with the above network and tools will allow us to build a set of classical language courses that will give students immediate success in daily colloquial communication. But, while we hope that the lessons allow students to engage with _eachother_ about typical modern topics in atypical ancient languages, we also hope our Latin community helps us write lessons that engage with writers of the past: Cicero, Virgil, Aquinas, Aristotle, Plato, and Homer.

## Who is Dr. Paul P.

Dr. Paul Pimsleur (1927-1976) was a scholar in the field of [applied linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_linguistics). He developed the Pimsleur language learning system, which, along with his many publications, had a significant effect upon theories of [language learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_learning) and teaching.[^1]

This Github organization, its projects, and its members are not associated with Beverly Pimsleur, Simon & Schuster, or [Pimsleur Language Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimsleur_Language_Programs)--a company that develops and publishes language learning courses.

We do not claim to create, provide, or sell language learning material by them or under the PIMSLEUR® trademark. We are simply an enthusiastic group of like-minded amateur educators attempting to create a beautiful language learning experience by planning, writing, recording, and distributing free, open, and creative commons language learning resources that we hope might be as effective as the methods described by freely available, online materials that embrace Dr. Paul P.'s language learning system.
